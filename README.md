Project description:
Welcome to the Job Satisfaction Survey Web Application! This project aims to provide a functional platform for creating and managing job satisfaction surveys. This README outlines the features of the second release and the project structure.

Features
1. Landing Page
Purpose: The main entry point of the web application, using this URL: http://localhost:3000/ or http://localhost:3000/surveyslist
Elements:
Site Name & team logo: Clearly displayed at the top.
Hero Button: A prominent button labeled "Create Survey" to initiate the survey creation process.
List of Surveys button: A dashboard view that lists active and publicly available surveys.

2. CRUD Functionality
Create: Users can create new surveys.
Read: Users can view a list of existing surveys along with their details.
Update: Users can edit existing surveys.
Delete: Users can delete surveys that are no longer needed.

3. Authentication
Navigation Items (or other UI elements) that allow the user to navigate to appropriate security pages (Login and Register) and Logout. When the user is not logged in, the navigation bar only show sthe Login link. When the user is logged in, the navigation bar only shows a Logout Navigation Item with a welcome message.
To edit or delete the user must be logged in for privacy. Otherwise, if the user is not logged in then they can only view or answer the surveys.

4. UI/UX
The user interface is functional but not super polished yet. The priority is on usability and core functionality.
